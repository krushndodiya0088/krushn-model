1)what is flutter?

Flutter is an open source framework developed and supported by Google. Frontend and full-stack developers use Flutter 
to build an applicationâ€™s user interface (UI) for multiple platforms with a single codebase.

When Flutter launched in 2018, it mainly supported mobile app development. Flutter now supports application development 
on six platforms: iOS, Android, the web, Windows, MacOS, and Linux.


2)why did you choose flutter 

The first Reason for choosing Flutter for the next project is development time. Flutter is based on dart language and if 
you are familiar with java and similar programming language it is really easy to learn Flutter. In Flutter logic and UI will
be written in the same code-base.


3)what is dart?

Dart is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. The programming language can be 
used to develop web and mobile apps as well as server and desktop applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, 
garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.


4)Difference between hybrid application and native application.

In a native app, your developers have to rewrite and redesign all the app functionality in the native development language. 
A hybrid app lets you write the app functionality in a single codebase. You can then wrap your code in a lightweight native 
app shell or container.
