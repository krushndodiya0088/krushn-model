/*

  Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows
   a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting all the properties and behaviors 
   of the existing class. The existing class is called the base class or parent class, while 
   the new class is called the derived class or child class.

Inheritance enables code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchical class structure,
 where classes can be organized in a logical and meaningful way. The derived class can inherit 
 all the members of the base class, such as fields, properties, methods, and events, and can also
  add its own members or override the inherited ones.

For example, suppose we have a class called "Person" that has fields for name, age, and address. 
We can create a derived class called "Student" that inherits from the "Person" class and adds its own 
fields such as student ID and GPA. The "Student" class can use all the fields and methods of the "Person"
 class and can also have its own unique properties and behaviors.

Overall, inheritance is a powerful concept in OOP that allows developers to create complex and efficient 
code by reusing existing classes and creating a hierarchy of classes.
