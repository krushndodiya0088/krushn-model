OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that focuses on the creation of objects that contain data and behavior, which interact with one another to perform tasks. Here are some of the key concepts in OOP:

Abstraction: The process of identifying essential features of an object and ignoring the non-essential ones.

Encapsulation: The practice of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface for accessing its functionality.

Inheritance: The ability to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors.

Polymorphism: The ability to use a single interface to represent multiple types of objects.

Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects that define a set of attributes and methods.

Object: An instance of a class that contains data and methods.

Method: A function defined within a class that can be called on an object.

Attribute: A variable defined within a class that holds data for an object.

Interface: A contract that specifies the methods that a class must implement.

Composition: The ability to combine multiple objects into a single object to achieve a more complex functionality.
