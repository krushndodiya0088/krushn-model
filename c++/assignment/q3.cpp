OOP and POP are two different programming paradigms:

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects,
     which can contain data and code (methods) that manipulate that data. OOP encourages encapsulation, 
     inheritance, and polymorphism, which are mechanisms for organizing and structuring code to make it more modular and reusable.

POP (Procedural Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of procedures,
 which are a series of instructions that perform a specific task. In POP, code is organized around functions or procedures that manipulate data, 
 and there is no concept of objects or classes.

The main difference between OOP and POP is that OOP is more focused on data abstraction and encapsulation,
    while POP is more focused on organizing code around procedures or functions. OOP is often used for large-scale 
    software development, while POP is often used for smaller programs or scripts.

In OOP, code is organized around classes, which define the behavior and properties of objects, while in POP, 
code is organized around functions or procedures that manipulate data. OOP emphasizes the reuse of code and modular design, 
while POP emphasizes the linear execution of code. OOP is often considered more complex than POP, but it can lead to more maintainable and scalable code in the long run.
